# SMS Spam Detection Project

This project is a web application for SMS Spam detection built using Flask and a Logistic Regression model. The model was trained with a TF-IDF vectorizer to classify SMS messages as either "SPAM" or "NOT SPAM".

## Features

- **Spam Detection**: Predicts whether an SMS message is spam.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alwinkscaria/sms-spam-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd sms-spam-detection
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have `pip` installed and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**:
   Start the Flask server by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

After running the Flask application, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the user interface. You can then input SMS messages to classify them as spam or not spam.
